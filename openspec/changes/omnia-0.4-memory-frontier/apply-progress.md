# Apply Progress: Omnia v0.4 Memory Frontier
## PR 1 — Config Scaffolding
- Completed tasks: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
- Remaining tasks: 2.1–11.12 remain unchecked in `tasks.md`.
- Boundary: seven default-OFF configuration blocks and parameter defaults only; no capability wiring or runtime behavior was added.
### TDD Cycle Evidence
| Task | Test File | Layer | Safety Net | RED | GREEN | TRIANGULATE | REFACTOR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | `internal/config/v04_config_test.go` | Unit | `go test ./internal/config/...` passed before change | Test referenced the seven absent `Config` fields; compile failed | Added the config fields; test passed | v0.3.2 fixture snapshot covers non-default legacy values | N/A |
| 1.2 | `internal/config/v04_config_test.go` | Unit | Covered by 1.1 baseline | Existing RED test could not compile until the seven types existed | Added structs and parameter-only defaults; targeted test passed | Opt-in-only config test verifies documented defaults | N/A |
| 1.3 | `internal/config/v04_config_test.go` | Unit | Covered by config suite | N/A (style-only) | Config tests passed after doc/style cleanup | Skipped: structural/documentation-only task | Confirmed no v0.4 `*KeyPresent` probe is present |
| 1.4 | `internal/config/v04_config_test.go` | Unit | Covered by config suite | N/A (verification-only) | Config suite, cgo-free build, and vet passed | Skipped: verification-only task | `git diff --check` passed |
### Verification
- `go test ./internal/config/...` — passed
- `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./...` — passed
- `go vet ./...` — passed
- `git diff --check` — passed
- The v0.3.2 fixture has no v0.4 keys and its legacy config snapshot is byte-for-byte equal to `v0.3.2-config.golden.yaml`.
### Design Deviations
None. The design, tasks, code, and security specification now consistently use `EncryptionConfig` with the `encryption` key; no `security` alias is provided.
